        Nice to meet your acquaintance, I'm Molly Porphura, as a professional graphic designer I've always had a
        critical eye for visuals which is why I decided to become a front end software developer. Since I was a child
        I've always hated the terribly designed user interfaces of the time so as an adult I've come to believe that I
        have an obligation as a great asset to apply my skills to improve upon anything I can, and all my previous work
        was simply a way to get me to a spot where I could. Not to say I didn't gain any skills along the way, in fact
        that's exactly what I did, Project Management, Working on Deadlines, Working with a Team. All skills I will
        apply in any future positions I take.
